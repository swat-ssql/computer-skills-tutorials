# Computer Skills Tutorials
These tutorials are designed to turn you into an efficient and effective computer user. They will help reduce the time it takes you to write an essay and aide your writing clarity. If you pursue more advanced computing, such as complex research projects or coding, they will save you time and headaches.

## Choose your approach

-   Complete each section independently. This is best if you know which skills would benefit you most.
-   Start at the beginning. The sections on ["Keyboard Skills"](keyboard.qmd) and ["Mouse/Trackpad Skills"](mouse_trackpad.qmd) are short and will provide the quickest gains in efficiency for most users. These sections and ["Organization within a Document"](doc_nav.qmd) can be completed on a tablet or computer.
-   Start at ["Environment Setup."](environment_setup.qmd) This section demonstrates how to download, save and organize your work in one document. Proceed to ["File Management."](file_management.qmd) These sections provide the biggest gains in efficiency. They also take longer to complete. Note that both sections are designed for PCs and Macs, which have sophisticated file management systems and flexible environments.
-   Complete the [Computer Skills Assessment](https://swat-ssql.github.io/computer-skills-assessment/) now, later, or in parts. Just like these tutorials, the assessment is modular. Depending on your comfort with the material, you can complete sections of the assessment or all of it. If you are already familiar with the skills and simply want to run a quick self assessment, skip these tutorials and head straight to the assessment.
