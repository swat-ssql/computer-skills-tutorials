# Computer Skills Tutorials
These tutorials will help you become an efficient and effective computer user. They will help reduce the time it takes you to write an essay and aide your writing clarity. If you pursue more advanced computing, such as complex research projects or coding, they will save you time and headaches.

## Choose your approach

Here are suggested options for completing these tutorials.

**Option 1**: Complete each section independently. This is best if you know which skills would benefit you most.

**Option 2**: Start at the beginning. The sections on ["Keyboard Skills"](keyboard.qmd) and ["Mouse/Trackpad Skills"](mouse_trackpad.qmd) are short and will provide the quickest gains in efficiency for most users. These sections and ["Organization within a Document"](doc_nav.qmd) can be completed on a tablet or computer.

**Option 3**: Start at ["Environment Setup."](environment_setup.qmd) Proceed to ["File Management."](file_management.qmd) These sections provide the biggest gains in efficiency. They also take longer to complete.

-   Both sections are designed for PCs and Macs, which have sophisticated file management systems and flexible environments.

-   ["Environment Setup"](environment_setup.qmd) demonstrates how to [download](https://github.com/swat-ssql/computer-skills-tutorials-docx/raw/refs/heads/main/Computer-Skills-Tutorials.docx), save and organize your work in one document. This allows you to

    i.  save your work,

    ii. practice skills while going through the tutorials in Google Docs or Microsoft Word, and

    iii. avoid rote copy-pasting text into a new Word document or Google Doc.

**Option 4**: Complete the Computer Skills Assessment now, later, or in parts. Just like these tutorials, the assessment is modular. Depending on your comfort with the material, you can complete sections of the assessment or all of it. If you are already familiar with the skills and simply want to run a quick self assessment, skip these tutorials. Head straight to either the [online](https://swat-ssql.github.io/computer-skills-assessment/) or [downloadable](https://github.com/swat-ssql/computer-skills-assessment-docx/raw/refs/heads/main/Computer-Skills-Assessment.docx) assessment.
