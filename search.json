This is best if you know which skills would benefit you most.\nOption 2: Start at the beginning. The sections on “Keyboard Skills” and “Mouse/Trackpad Skills” are short and will provide the quickest gains in efficiency for most users. These sections and “Organization within a Document” can be completed on a tablet or computer.\nOption 3: Start at “Environment Setup.” This section demonstrates how to download, save and organize your work in one document. Proceed to “File Management.” These sections provide the biggest gains in efficiency. They also take longer to complete. Note that both sections are designed for PCs and Macs, which have sophisticated file management systems and flexible environments.\n\nOption 4: Complete the Computer Skills Assessment now, later, or in parts. Just like these tutorials, the assessment is modular. Depending on your comfort with the material, you can complete sections of the assessment or all of it. If you are already familiar with the skills and simply want to run a quick self assessment, skip these tutorials. Head straight to either the online or downloadable assessment.",

This lets you see the origin of your information at the same time as you see the new location for your information. When information is visible at both its origin and destination, you can copy-paste and drag-drop that information more efficiently than also having to recall and re-order windows. This can help:\n\nmanage files and folders,\ncopy and paste information from a browser into a Google Doc/Word document,\nsimultaneously view tutorials and apply the skills in real time,\nand much more.\n\nThis may take some practice to apply quickly and effectively.\nNote that some computer users take this to an extra level. They use two or more computer screens to enhance the amount of information displayed and available for organizing. For example, I currently have the Word version of this document open, along with the Computer Skills Assessment, a set of notes from a workshop on computer skills, and an application to edit the screen grabs included in this document. These documents are organized across two screens for easy access to information.\n\nMore specialized computer programs will arrange your windows for you. For example, I edited much of this tutorial in RStudio, a statistical programming language that also creates webbooks. You can see that RStudio organizes my information so that I can see the text of the document, a navigation pane, and my file structure.\n\n\n\nPath bars\nA path bar is a navigational tool in file management applications that shows your location in a file system by displaying your current visible folder and the folders it is nested within.\nThe path bar has many uses. You can:\n\nsee where your files are located at all times,\ncopy the location of your files in text form, and\nnavigate up your folder tree by clicking on higher level folders in the path bar.\n\nOn a Mac in the Finder application, the path bar is hidden by default. You can change this default by opening Finder and clicking View -&gt; Show Path Bar in the Finder menu options. The path will appear at the bottom of the Finder application window. Navigate your folder structure by clicking on folders in the path bar. Copy the path address by right (secondary click) clicking on the path and selecting “Copy path.”\nOn a PC, the path bar is always visible in the upper portion of the File Explorer application. Navigate your folder structure by clicking on folders in the path bar. Copy the path address by clicking into the blank white space next to the path bar and pressing Ctrl+c.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMac\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPC\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional information on organizing your files can be found in “File Management” &gt; “File Structure”.\n\n\nMouse/trackpad settings\n\nSearch for your mouse/trackpad settings by searching for “Mouse Settings” in your spotlight search on a Mac (press Command + space bar) and the search bar (bottom left) on File Explorer and see if you want to adjust any settings.\nOn a Mac, mice/trackpads may not have easy access to a right (secondary) click. You can access the secondary click menu by pressing Ctrl+click at any time, but this is inefficient. For a more accessible right click, adjust your mouse settings or install a third-party app such as BetterTouchTool.\n\n\n\nWord processor setup: the navigation pane\nWhen working with a text-based document or note that has more than a page of text, document organization can help. Document headers provide many organizational benefits, including:\n\nidea organization,\ndocument navigation by clicking on the relevant part of the outline in the side panel,\ninteractive tables of contents,\ndocument accessibility, and\nfacilitate teamwork and delegation.\n\nIn Microsoft Word, you can see a navigation pane with all headers, which creates an interactive table of contents. To access the navigation pane, go to the View ribbon. In the “Show” section, click “Navigation Pane.” Make sure you are in the Document Map (Mac) or Headings (PC) section of the panel on the left\nGoogle Docs opens the navigation pane by default. You may need to click the list icon at the top left of your screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft Word (PC)\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft Word (Mac)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Docs",

Ideally, this is done using a structured system that facilitates retrieval, because we all inevitably forget where something is.\nThe developers of modern computers have gradually added barriers to creating useful file structures on a computer. Yet file management is critical to:\nFile management is almost entirely inaccessible on most tablets and smartphones. It is readily possible on a computer but requires a few additional clicks and environment adjustments. As such, this section is designed for a Mac or PC computer, not a tablet. Similar principles apply to a Chromebook but they are not demonstrated here.\nFile tags provide additional organization. They should be used as secondary file organization tools and not primary organization tools like a file structure. The file structure creates a unique internal address for a file that is quite useful for advanced computing.\nPractice these skills while reading the tutorial, during everyday computing work, and in the practice tasks at the end of this section.",

It displays your current visible folder and the folders it is nested within. It allows you to copy the address of your file in text form. It also lets you navigate up your folder tree by clicking on higher level folders in the path bar. It is useful in many contexts, and critical for coding projects. Alternate methods exist for each of these tasks, but the path bar accomplishes all of them and is similar on Macs and PCs.\n\nMac\nThe path bar on a Mac is hidden by default, but can be displayed by clicking View &gt; Show Path Bar in the Finder menu options. The path will appear at the bottom of the screen. The path can be copied by right clicking on the path and selecting “Copy path”.\n\n\n\nPC\nThe path bar is always visible in Window’s File Explorer. To access the text version of the path, click into the blank white space next to the path bar.\n\n\n\nGoogle Drive’s path, of a sort\nGoogle Drive also has a folder structure, but it is not nearly as useful or accessible as Mac’s Finder or Window’s File Explorer. It is difficult to copy the path address (as of Summer 2025). That said, the path does appear at the top of your Google Drive screen. You may need to click three little dots to the left of the path to access the full path information.\n\n\n\n\nFile structure\nA file structure is how you organize and store your files and folders for easy access and management of files.\n\nThe Documents folder\nOn a Mac and PC, you should default to creating a file structure in the “Documents” folder. This is the location intended for permanent file storage for most users. Instructions for alternatives, such as setting up a synced Google Drive, can be found on Google.\nNote that your Downloads folder is intended for temporary storage. Many of the files you download, such as installers, are intended to be temporary files. Yet they can take up a lot of space. As such, good computer hygiene involves moving needed files out of your Downloads folder and then deleting the contents of your Downloads folder on a regular basis. This makes your Downloads folder uniquely unsuitable for permanent storage.\n\n\nClean out the Downloads folder\nIf you store your files in your Downloads folder, you do not have to fix it all at once. Instead, create a plausible file structure in your Documents folder, as described below. Move all contents of your Downloads folder to a folder named “Downloads (insert date)” inside your Documents folder. For all future downloads of potentially permanent files, save them in your Documents folder in a reasonable location. Over time, you can remove things from the copied Downloads folder titled “Downloads (insert date)” that now lives in your Documents folder. Delete unneeded files. Move others to reasonable locations in your Documents folder. Remove temptation to use your Downloads folder as permanent storage by regularly deleting all the files that end up there. The files in the downloads folder should all be temporary anyways.\n\n\nFolder system organization principles\n\nHuman brains track time-based categories well. When topics are nicely confined inside a time frame, contain them in folders devoted to a year, season, or semester.\nHuman brains also track project-based categories well. You can organize folders devoted to particular parts of projects.\nLeverage the alpha-numeric ordering required by the Finder (Mac)/File Explorer (PC) programs.\n\nStart file and folder names with the year when applicable. Add the month and/or day after the year.\nUse spaces and punctuation strategically. “2026 Summer” is before “2026Fall”, because a space “ ” comes before “F” in the alpha-numeric order.\nStart commonly used files and folders with the beginning of the alphabet. Even putting “1” or “aa” at the beginning of a file or folder can be effective, albeit inelegant.\n\nHuman brains track time-based categories well. When topics are nicely confined inside a time period, you can contain them in folders devoted to a year, season, semester, or quarter.\nBalance the depth of your folders (how many folders are nested within each other) and the breadth of your folders (how many folders are within one single folder). Too deep, and you will spend too much time clicking into folders. Too broad, and you will have a hard time finding the folder you want. One suggestion is to keep your regularly/recently used files broad. Bucket older/less used files into a few folders.\nGoogle “computer file structure principles” to find more information about file structure systems.\n\n\n\nExample folder system\nThe following is an example of a folder system that has been used successfully by many students and faculty. You can download this example at this link: sample folder structure. Change the years to fit your situation. Adjust semester to quarters or any other subdivision as needed. Select the folder and press “F2” on a PC and “Enter” on a Mac to rename the folder.\n\n\n\n\nQuick access/Favorites\nDrag and drop regularly used folders into your “Quick Access” (PC) or “Favorites” (Mac) panel on the left side of your Finder (Mac)/File Explorer (PC).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMac\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindow management\nWindow management refers to how the user places program windows on their screen. For example, a user might have two windows side-by-side on their screen. Or, if they are using a small laptop screen, they might only look at one window at a time.\nLooking at one window at a time and then swiping between windows or using keyboard shortcuts to navigate between windows can be useful for consuming information. For managing information, it can be helpful to show the original location at the same time as a location with new organization.\nFor files and folders, this means displaying a file’s origin window at the same time as you see the destination window. When you have both windows up, you can more efficiently move and organize files and folders than when you have to search and find windows before dragging and dropping files. For example, with the window configuration below, I can rapidly drag and drop the “Computer Skills” folder into my “all workshops” folder.\n\n\n\nSaving files in Microsoft Office\nMicrosoft Office hides the file structure by default when you save a document to simplify the interface. When you save a document (Save or Save As), the first screen tries to guess where you want to save it. If you have a clear file structure, its guess should only be accurate if you were working in the same location repetitively. This section shows how to access your file structure via the Browse button (PC) or a downward facing button (Mac).\nTo change the setting permanently, Google “customize the save experience in office”.\nYour screen may look slightly different than what is shown here. If it is too different to interpret, Google “Browse file structure from save word” to find a guide suited to your computer’s environment.\n\nPC\nOn a PC, click “Browse” from the “Save” or “Save As” screen. In the resulting File Explorer window, browse to the appropriate folder and click “Save”.\n\n\n\nMac\nOn a Mac, click the downward facing arrow next to “Where” from the “Save” or “Save As” screen. In the resulting Finder window, browse to the appropriate folder and click “Save”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeyboard commands to navigate the Finder/File Explorer windows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShortcut type\nKey combo (PC)\nKey combo (Mac)\nAction\n\n\nMoving between screens/windows\nAlt+`\n(on some PCs)\nCmd+`\nMove forward between Finder (Mac)/File Explorer (PC) windows\n\n\n\nAlt +shift+`\nCmd+shift+`\nMove backward between Finder (Mac)/File Explorer (PC) windows\n\n\n\n\nCmd+tab\nSwitch between open applications.

If you are on a PC, skip this step.\nSet up and/or clean up your file structure. This could take a substantial amount of time. I recommend spending 10 minutes now to set up the general organization structure. Then schedule an hour in the next week to make progress on your organization. If you store files in your Downloads folder, pay particular attention to the section on cleaning out the Downloads folder.\nOpen a Finder (Mac)/File Explorer (PC) window. Arrange it so you can see these instructions and your Finder (Mac)/File Explorer (PC) window at the same time.\nCopy the path of one folder. You do not need to do anything with it, just know that you can copy it.\nOpen a new window with Cmd+n (Mac)/Ctrl+n (PC). Open a different folder in one of the windows.\nCreate a new folder (in either window) using Cmd+shift+n (Mac)/Ctrl+shift+n (PC).\nRename that folder.\nMove the folder to your second window by dragging and dropping it.\nCmd+z (Mac) or Ctrl+z (PC) to undo the move.\n\nThe following video shows an example of tasks 5-8.",

To see the navigation pane in Microsoft Word, go to the View ribbon. In the “Show” section, click “Navigation Pane.” Google Docs opens the navigation pane by default. You may need to click the list icon at the top left of your screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft Word\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Docs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeading structure\nDecide what level of heading you want to apply. If it’s a first order topical heading like “Organization within a Document” above, that is a level 1 heading. If it’s a second order heading like “Mouse/trackpad method to select headings” below, that is a level 2 heading.\n\n\nMouse/trackpad method to select headings\nYou can select a heading from the “Styles” section of the “Home” ribbon using a mouse/trackpad. This is straightforward but takes more time than using keyboard shortcuts.\n\n\nKeyboard method to select headings\nHeadings are especially practical if you memorize the keystrokes to generate them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nMicrosoft Word\n(PC)\nGoogle Docs\n(PC)\nMicrosoft Word\n(Mac)\nGoogle Docs\n(Mac)\n\n\nHeading level 1\nCtrl+alt+1\nCtrl+alt+1\nCmd+option+1\nCmd+option+1\n\n\nHeading level 2\nCtrl+alt+2\nCtrl+alt+2\nCmd+option+2\nCmd+option+2\n\n\nHeading level 3\nCtrl+alt+3\nCtrl+alt+3\nCmd+option+3\nCmd+option+3\n\n\nNormal\nCtrl+shift+n\nCtrl+alt+0\nCmd+shift+n\nCmd+option+0\n\n\nHeading dialogue box\nCtrl+shift+s\n\n(see text below)\n\n\n\n\nNote that Google Docs can create additional heading levels beyond level 3 using the same keyboard shortcut pattern. Microsoft Word stops keyboard shortcuts after heading level 3, although Ctrl+shift+s (PC) provides a handy alternative for lower-level headings. A more complex solution for a Mac can be found by Googling “mac apply styles shortcut word.”\nSometimes you might need to change multiple headers from UPPER CASE to Title Case or lower case. A handy trick in Microsoft Word is to change the case pattern of text using shift+f3 (PC) and Cmd+shift+a (Mac). Put your cursor in the middle of the word you want to change, then press the keyboard combination above.\n\n\nChange format of all headers\nOn either platform, you can adjust heading formats easily with the following steps.\n\nMove to one of the existing headers a document. Change the format. For example, you can bold it. Keep your cursor blinking on that header.\nMake all headers with that level match your new format\n\nMicrosoft Word: Select the “Home” ribbon. In the “style” section, right click on the appropriate header. Click “update to match selection.”\nGoogle Docs: Click into the heading section of the ribbon. Move your cursor to the appropriate heading. Click “Update heading __ to match.”\n\nAll headings of that level will now match the format of the heading your cursor started on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft Word\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Docs",
