The sections on “Keyboard Skills” and “Mouse/Trackpad Skills” are short and will provide the quickest gains in efficiency for most users. These sections and “Organization within a Document” can be completed on a tablet or computer.\nStart at “Environment Setup.” This section demonstrates how to download, save and organize your work in one document. Proceed to “File Management.” These sections provide the biggest gains in efficiency. They also take longer to complete. Note that both sections are designed for PCs and Macs, which have sophisticated file management systems and flexible environments.\nComplete the Computer Skills Assessment now, later, or in parts. Just like these tutorials, the assessment is modular. Depending on your comfort with the material, you can complete sections of the assessment or all of it. If you are already familiar with the skills and simply want to run a quick self assessment, skip these tutorials. Head straight to either the online or downloadable assessment.",

This lets you see the origin of your information at the same time as you see the new location for your information. When information is visible at both its origin and destination, you can copy-paste and drag-drop that information efficiently. This helps\n\nmanage files and folders,\ncopy and paste information from a browser into a Google Doc/Word document,\nsimultaneously view tutorials and apply the skills in real time,\nand much more.\n\nThis may take some practice. Typical modern computer users swipe between screens. While this is useful for consuming information and some parts of writing, it can be impractical for creating and managing information.\nNote that many expert computer users take this to an extra level. They use two or more computer screens to enhance the amount of information displayed and available for organizing. For example, I currently have the Word version of this document open, along with the Computer Skills Assessment, a set of notes from a workshop on computer skills, and an application to edit the screen grabs included in this document. These documents are organized across two screens for easy access to information.\n\nMore specialized computer programs will arrange your windows for you. For example, I edited much of this tutorial in RStudio, a statistical programming language that also creates webbooks. You can see that RStudio organizes my information so that I can see the text of the document, a navigation pane, and my file structure.\n\n\n\nPath bars\nThe path bar has many uses. You can:\n\nsee where your files are located at all times,\ncopy the location of your files in text form, and\nnavigate up your folder tree by clicking on higher level folders in the path bar.\n\nOn a Mac, the path bar is hidden by default. You can change this default by clicking View -&gt; Show Path Bar in the Finder menu options. The path will appear at the bottom of the screen. Navigate up your folder structure by clicking on folders in the path bar. Copy the path address by right clicking on the path and selecting “Copy path.”\nOn a PC, the path bar is always visible. Navigate up your folder structure by clicking on folders in the path bar. Copy the path address by clicking into the blank white space next to the path bar and pressing Ctrl+c.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMac\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPC\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional information on organizing your files can be found in “File Management” &gt; “File Structure”.\n\n\nMouse/trackpad settings\n\nSearch for your mouse/trackpad settings by searching for “Mouse Settings” in your spotlight search. See if you want to adjust any settings.\nOn a Mac, mice/trackpads may not have easy access to a right click. You can compensate by pressing Ctrl+click, but this is inefficient. For a more accessible right click, adjust your settings or install a third-party app such as BetterTouchTool.\n\n\n\nWord processor setup: the navigation pane\nDocument headers provide many benefits, including:\n\nidea organization,\ndocument navigation by clicking on the relevant part of the outline in the side panel,\ninteractive tables of contents,\ndocument accessibility.\n\nIn Microsoft Word, you can see a navigation pane with all headers, which creates an interactive table of contents. To access the navigation pane, go to the View ribbon. In the “Show” section, click “Navigation Pane.” Make sure you are in the Document Map (Mac) or Headings (PC) section of the panel on the left\nGoogle Docs opens the navigation pane by default.

It is useful in many contexts, and critical for coding projects. Alternate methods exist for each of these tasks, but the path bar accomplishes all of them and is similar on Macs and PCs.\n\nMac\nThe path bar on a Mac is hidden by default, but can be displayed by clicking View &gt; Show Path Bar in the Finder menu options. The path will appear at the bottom of the screen. The path can be copied by right clicking on the path and selecting “Copy path”.\n\n\n\nPC\nThe path bar is always visible in Window’s File Explorer. To access the text version of the path, click into the blank white space next to the path bar.\n\n\n\nGoogle Drive’s path, of a sort\nGoogle Drive also has a folder structure, but it is not nearly as useful or accessible as Mac’s Finder or Window’s File Explorer. It is difficult to copy the path address (as of Summer 2025). That said, the path does appear at the top of your Google Drive screen. You may need to click three little dots to the left of the path to access the full path information.\n\n\n\n\nFile structure\n\nDocuments folder\nOn a Mac and PC, you should default to creating a file structure in the “Documents” folder. This is the location intended for permanent file storage for most users. There are alternatives, such as storing your files in a synced Google Drive or Dropbox account.\nNote that your Downloads folder is intended for temporary storage. Many of the files you download, such as installers, are intended to be temporary files. Yet they can take up a lot of space. As such, good computer hygiene involves deleting your Downloads folder on a regular basis. This makes your Downloads folder uniquely unsuitable for permanent storage.\n\n\nClean out the Downloads folder\nIf you store your files in your Downloads folder, you do not have to fix it all at once. Create a plausible file structure in your Documents folder, as described below. Move all contents of your Downloads folder to a folder named “Downloads (insert date)” inside your Documents folder. For all future downloads of potentially permanent files, save them in your Documents folder in a reasonable location. Over time, you can remove things from the copied Downloads folder that now lives in your Documents folder. Delete unneeded files. Move others to reasonable locations in your Documents folder. Remove temptation to use your Downloads folder as permanent storage by regularly deleting all the files that end up there. They should all be temporary anyways.\n\n\nFolder system principles\n\nLeverage the alpha-numeric ordering required by the Finder (Mac)/File Explorer (PC) programs.\n\nStart file and folder names with the year when applicable. Add the month and/or date after the year. Use spaces and punctuation strategically. For example, “2026 Summer” comes before “2026Fall”, because a space “ ” comes before “F” in the alpha-numeric order.\nStart commonly used files and folders with the beginning of the alphabet. Even putting “1” or “aa” at the beginning of a file or folder can be effective, albeit inelegant.\n\nHuman brains track time-based categories well. When topics are nicely confined inside a time period, you can contain them in folders devoted to a year, season, semester, or quarter.\nBalance the depth of your folders (how many folders are nested within each other) and the breadth of your folders (how many folders are within one single folder). Too deep, and you will spend too much time clicking into folders. Too broad, and you will have a hard time finding the folder you want. One suggestion is to keep your regularly/recently used files fairly broad. Bucket your older/less used files into a few folders.\nGoogle “computer file structure principles” to find more information about file structure systems.\n\n\n\nExample folder system\nThe following is an example of a folder system that has been used successfully by many students and faculty. You can download this example at this link: sample folder structure. Change the years to fit your situation. Adjust semester to quarters or any other subdivision as needed. Select the folder and press “F2” on a PC and “Enter” on a Mac to rename the folder.\n\n\n\n\nQuick access/Favorites\nDrag and drop regularly used folders into your “Quick Access” (PC) or “Favorites” (Mac) panel on the left side of your Finder (Mac)/File Explorer (PC).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMac\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindow management\nTypical modern computer users swipe between screens. This is useful for consuming information. For managing information, you want to show the original location at the same time as the new organized location.\nFor files and folders, this means displaying a file’s origin at the same time as you see the window with its destination. You can then efficiently move and organize files and folders. For example, with the window configuration below, I can rapidly drag and drop the “Computer Skills” folder into my “all workshops” folder.\n\n\n\nSaving files in Microsoft Office\nMicrosoft Office has begun to hide the file structure when you save a document. When you save a document (Save or Save As), the first screen tries to guess where you want to save it. If you have a clear file structure, its guess should only be accurate if you were working in the same location repetitively. This section demonstrates how to access your file structure via the Browse button (PC) or a downward facing button (Mac).\nAn alternative to this section is to change the setting permanently. Google “customize the save experience in office”.\nYour screen may look slightly different than what is shown here.

This will take a substantial amount of time. I recommend spending 10 minutes now to set up the general organization structure. Then schedule an hour in the next week to make progress on your organization. If you store files in your Downloads folder, pay particular attention to the section on cleaning out the Downloads folder.\nOpen a Finder (Mac)/File Explorer (PC) window. Arrange it so you can see these instructions and your Finder (Mac)/File Explorer (PC) window at the same time.\nCopy the path of one folder. You do not need to do anything with it, just know that you can copy it.\nOpen a new window with Cmd+n (Mac)/Ctrl+n (PC). Open a different folder in one of the windows.\nCreate a new folder (in either window) using Cmd+shift+n (Mac)/Ctrl+shift+n (PC).\nRename that folder.\nMove the folder to your second window by dragging and dropping it.\nCmd+z (Mac) or Ctrl+z (PC) to undo the move.\n\nThe following video shows an example of tasks 5-8.",

You can cycle between UPPER CASE, Camel Case, and lower case.\n\n\nChange format of all headers\nOn either platform, you can adjust heading formats easily with the following steps:\n\nMove to one of the existing headers in this document, such as “Theory”. Change the format; you can bold it, for example. Keep your cursor blinking on that header.\nTo make all headers with that level match your new format\n\nMicrosoft Word: Select the “Home” ribbon. In the “style” section, right click on the appropriate header. Click “update to match selection.”\nGoogle Docs: Click into the heading section of the ribbon.
